```

See [package.json](package.json) for all tasks.

## Doing dynamic things

A few resources for doing anything you can imagine with a 100% static site/app on the JAMstack
using Next.js.

## Deploying to Netlify

The deploy to Netlify button above will create a new site and repo in one click. If you've created your repo manually, you can deploy to Netlify as follows:

- Push your clone to your own GitHub repository.
- [Create a new site on Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and link the repository.

Now Netlify will build and deploy your site whenever you push to git.
